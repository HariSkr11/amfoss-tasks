# TASK-09 

I have completed the task of scrapping the details of top 50 cryptocurrencies.

I have also completed the implementation of adding the details in a csv file.

I am providing a gif for the same below 

For running the program I used the command **cargo run** 

The output will be stored in a csv file called **test.csv**
