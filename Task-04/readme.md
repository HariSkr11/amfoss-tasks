# TASK-04

For TASK-04 I was told to implement a telegram bot as per the demo. 

I have successfully implemented the same .

For running the bot, the command **source bin/activate** should be executed for activating

the virtual environment followed by running the python file using 

the command **python -m bot.py**

I have provided a screen recording of the output that i got in the directory

named **Output recording.mp4**
