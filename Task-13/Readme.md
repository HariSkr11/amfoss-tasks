# Task-13

In this task, I have implemented the system by using a PIR Motion sensor, Ardiuno Uno, Push button and a LCD Display

The sensor keeps track of the info on how many people go in and out of the shop. The result is displayed on a LCD screen 

The push button resets the counter back to 0

I have also made a recording of the working along with the folder
